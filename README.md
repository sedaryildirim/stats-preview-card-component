## My process

Started with designing mobile first to get into better habits while following challenge screenshot
as closely as possible - had to restart a few times as i was playing with gred and flexbox and
had trouble getting it responsive, discovered how to use @media queries which helped.

### Built with

- HTML5 
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- How to make custom CSS Variables with :root and assign custom --cc and --ff 
- How to use @media to make site responsive
- Mobile first workflow
- Image::before properties

### Continued development
